Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, And I'll be there
You are my love, You are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl quit playing
We're just friends, What are you sayin'
So there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time,
And I was like
Baby, baby, baby oohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine mine
